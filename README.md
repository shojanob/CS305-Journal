Client Summary: Artemis Financial is a consulting firm that provides individualized financial planning services. The company sought assistance in securing its RESTful web application against external threats and modernizing its software security practices.

Identifying Vulnerabilities: I thoroughly reviewed the application’s code, identified potential security weaknesses such as SQL injection risks and hardcoded credentials, and documented actionable solutions. Secure coding prevents data breaches, ensures compliance, and maintains client trust.

Challenges and Insights: The most challenging aspect was manually reviewing the code for security flaws, while static testing provided valuable insights by identifying known vulnerabilities. This process highlighted the importance of structured vulnerability assessments.

Enhancing Security Layers: I applied multiple security measures, including input validation, dependency updates, and authentication controls. In the future, I would use automated security scanners, penetration testing, and industry best practices to evaluate and mitigate vulnerabilities.

Ensuring Functionality and Security: I verified the application’s security and functionality through manual code review, testing, and static analysis. After refactoring, I re-ran security tests to confirm no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

Helpful Resources: I used OWASP Dependency Check, Spring Boot security best practices, and secure coding principles, which will be valuable for future security assessments and software development tasks.

Demonstrating Skills to Employers: I would showcase my ability to conduct vulnerability assessments, implement security best practices, and write detailed mitigation plans, demonstrating my expertise in secure software development.
